This is a Word Suggestion project.
It suggests a range of words based on the first few letters that you provide in the input text field.
Tech Stack is:- 
-> HTML5
-> Vanilla JavaScript
-> AJAX
-> PHP 8.0+

When you type few letters in the input text field, then those letters are sent to the php script via ajax.
The php script checks those letters against an array of words.
It then returns an array of words that starts with those few letters that you send.
There is no Search or Enter button after you type first few letters.
So the result is shown at the moment you type a letter.
The search method in php script is Linear Search Algorithm as the dataset is very small.
But make sure that you start the apache server in XAMPP before you start using this project.
Follow above step in other servers if you are not using XAMPP.
If you start your server like XAMPP and then access your file, the file is opened successfully.
Otherwise, you will see an alert message 'Please start your server.'.
